# Kaffa Mobile
Pre-qualification test (v1.10)

#### Description:
My solutions were made using REACT Js, mainly, and Django (REST Server Exercise).
I made a single application that holds all solucions as different components.
Some exercises had similar ideas so I merged them:

* Exercise 1 and Exercise 2;
* Exercise 5 and Exercise 6.

I added the solution to Exercises 7 and 8 to the APP as well, even it being documentation only.

#### How to run the application

## Solucion 1 - Validade CPNJ

#### Exercise:
**1) Validate CNPJ format and check digits**
Given a string, check if it looks like a CNPJ, considering two formats:
Formatted:
"00.000.000/0000-00"
Number only:
"00000000000000"
Validate if it's a well-formed CNPJ, considering the "check digits", as defined by Receita Federal.
Important: Don't use a library. You should write the validation code.
